# 📚 JavaScript Basic Exercises

Hello! 👋 I'm Syifa, an Informatics Engineering student exploring the world of JavaScript from the basics. 
This is a collection of simple exercises and experiments I worked on to understand the fundamental concepts of JavaScript—especially **functions** and **DOM manipulation**.

---

## 🔧 What I Learned

- Function Declaration & Expression  
- Arrow Function ✨  
- Parameters vs Arguments  
- Return Statement  
- Default Parameters  
- Basic DOM Manipulation  
  (event `onclick`, `onmouseenter`, `style`, `getElementById`, etc)

## 📁 Project Structure

<pre><code>
├── index.html ← Main UI + links to all JS files
├── function.js ← Exercises focused on functions
├── dom.js ← DOM manipulation experiments
├── main.js ← General/free JavaScript practice (mix of concepts)
├── README.md ← Project documentation
</code></pre>

> 💬 *Note: This is a personal practice project. The code is still simple and includes a lot of comments for better understanding.*

## 🎯 Goals

- Document the learning process publicly  
- Practice using Git & GitHub  
- Build a portfolio starting from the basics ✨

---

## 🚀 Next Goals

- Learn Array & Object manipulation  
- Work on small interactive mini projects  
- Move to Intermediate JavaScript  
  (Event Listener, Fetch API, etc)  
- Start structuring folders with ES6 Modules
